## Troubleshooting

### Use global types as root generic type parameters of `defineProps`

If you want to use global types as root generic type parameters of `defineProps` like `defineProps<MyComponentProps>` Vue is going to drop an exception like: `ERROR  Pre-transform error: [@vue/compiler-sfc] Unresolvable type reference or unsupported built-in utility type`. This is a bug in Nuxt/Vue and made ticket in their tracker for it: https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/29757

Until it is solved, you can bypass this problem by using this syntax:
```js
const { propType } = defineProps<{ propType: MyGlobalPropType }>()
```
